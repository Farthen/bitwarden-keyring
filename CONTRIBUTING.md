## Statement

PRs are welcome, I (@ewjoachim) will try to provide mentorship and guidance to anyone who asks.
This projects supports diversity and all contributors are required to follow the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Tests

Tests are written with pytest, and with a high coverage. Please make sure to separate
IOs when possible and to mock as little as possible.
We're still lacking proper integration tests with a bitwarden in a docker.
